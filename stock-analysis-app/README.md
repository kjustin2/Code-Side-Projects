6. **Error Transparency**: Clear messaging when data quality issues occur

### Troubleshooting Real Data Issues

**"Unable to fetch real-time data" Error:**
- **Most Common**: Finnhub rate limit exceeded (60 calls/minute)
- **Solution**: Wait 1 minute and try again, or upgrade Finnhub plan
- **Backup**: Application automatically tries Yahoo Finance
- **Verify**: Stock symbol is correct (e.g., AAPL, not Apple)
- **Check**: Symbol trades on supported exchanges (NYSE, NASDAQ, etc.)

**Performance Issues (>10 seconds loading):**
- **Check browser console** for specific error messages
- **Verify network connectivity** to external APIs
- **Try different stock symbols** - some may have limited data
- **Clear browser cache** and try again

**API Rate Limiting:**
- **Finnhub Free**: 60 calls/minute, 100,000/month
- **Recommendation**: Sufficient for personal analysis and testing
- **Upgrade options**: Paid plans for higher limits if needed
- **Smart caching**: 2-minute cache reduces API calls automatically

**Empty charts or missing indicators:**
- Symbol may be delisted or suspended from trading
- Market may be closed (affects real-time updates)
- Try a different time period (1w, 1m, 3m)
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

**No news available:**
- Normal for smaller or international stocks
- Finnhub focuses on US stocks for free tier
- Application continues working without news
- RSS feeds provide backup general financial news

**API Key Issues:**
- **Local development**: Check `.env.local` file exists with correct key
- **Production**: Verify GitHub Secret `FINNHUB_API_KEY` is set correctly
- **Testing**: Console shows "‚úÖ Finnhub API key loaded successfully"
- **Fallback**: App works with Yahoo Finance even without Finnhub key

### Development Tips

```bash
# Verify API key is loaded (check console)
npm run dev

# Test with various stock symbols
# Check console for data source success messages

# Build for production
npm run build
```
